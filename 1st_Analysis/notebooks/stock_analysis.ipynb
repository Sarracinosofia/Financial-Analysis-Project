    "The table shows the main descriptive statistics calculated from the adjusted daily returns of five technology companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Mean Daily Return:\n",
    "Tesla (TSLA) has the highest mean daily return (0.0030), indicating greater average daily growth over the analyzed period. Apple (AAPL) has a mean daily return of 0.0012, followed by Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) with 0.0010, and Amazon (AMZN) with 0.0009. This suggests that Tesla offered the highest average daily return but, as we will see, with higher volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Volatility (Standard Deviation):\n",
    "TSLA also shows the highest volatility (0.0423), nearly twice that of the other stocks, indicating that its price is much more unstable and risky. Amazon (0.0227) has the second highest volatility, while Microsoft (0.0192) and Apple (0.0200) are the most stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Skewness:\n",
    "Most stocks have skewness values close to zero, indicating relatively symmetric distributions of daily returns. Tesla (0.2121) and Apple (0.1055) show slight positive skewness, suggesting a tendency towards more positive daily returns, though with some asymmetry. Google and Microsoft present very slight negative skewness, indicating returns slightly tilted toward small losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Kurtosis:\n",
    "All assets show kurtosis values greater than 3, indicating heavy tails (more extreme events than predicted by a normal distribution). Microsoft has the highest kurtosis (7.0872), suggesting a higher frequency of extreme returns, while Tesla has the lowest kurtosis (3.1031) within this group, though it still indicates heavy tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla stands out for having the highest mean daily return but also the highest volatility and skewness, showing a profile of higher risk and potential reward. Microsoft and Apple are the stocks with the lowest volatility and greater stability in daily returns, although with a higher probability of extreme events according to kurtosis."

    "Analysis and conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Return vs Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "TSLA had the highest final return (around 1408%), but also the highest volatility (67%), showing that it‚Äôs a high-risk, high-reward stock. In contrast, MSFT and AAPL had more moderate returns (around 2.7 to 3.4 times) and lower volatility (about 30%), indicating a more stable performance. This clearly reflects the risk-return tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Sharpe Ratio and Risk-Adjusted Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "TSLA also has the highest Sharpe Ratio (1.12), meaning it compensated for its risk better than the others despite the volatility. AAPL and MSFT have solid Sharpe Ratios above 0.8, which is good. AMZN had the lowest Sharpe (~0.65), showing its returns didn‚Äôt fully justify the risk taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Maximum Drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "TSLA experienced a maximum drawdown of 73%, meaning it had significant dips along the way. AAPL and MSFT had more moderate drawdowns (31-37%), which might be more appealing to risk-averse investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢ Correlation Between Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and AMZN are highly correlated (above 0.59), so they tend to move together. TSLA is less correlated (0.40-0.48), which could help diversify a tech-focused portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Recommendations:\n",
    "Even though TSLA has the highest return and Sharpe Ratio, its high volatility and drawdown make it risky. Combining it with more stable stocks like AAPL or MSFT can help balance risk and reward. It‚Äôs important not to focus only on returns but also on metrics like Sharpe Ratio and drawdown to get a clearer picture of risk. Including less correlated stocks can improve diversification and reduce overall portfolio volatility."

    "‚Ä¢\tAnnual Returns:\n",

    "‚Ä¢\tVolatility:\n",

    "‚Ä¢\tCorrelations:\n",
    "Stocks were highly correlated, especially during volatile market phases ‚Äî a critical consideration for portfolio diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tRisk-Return Tradeoff:\n",
    "Higher returns were generally associated with higher volatility. TSLA showed extreme values on both axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tSharpe Ratios (Risk-Adjusted Performance):\n",
    "2023 delivered the best Sharpe ratios across all assets.\n",
    "GOOGL and MSFT outperformed in 2021.\n",
    "2022 showed negative Sharpe ratios for all, indicating poor compensation for risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tDaily Return Distributions (Boxplots):\n",
    "TSLA showed the widest spread and most outliers, consistent with its volatility.\n",
    "MSFT and AAPL had narrower, more symmetric distributions, suggesting more predictable price behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Final Thoughts\n",

    "This analysis establishes a strong foundation for understanding the behavior and dynamics of these key tech stocks.\n",
    "Notably, MSFT, AAPL, and GOOGL demonstrated consistent and efficient risk-adjusted performance, making them attractive for conservative or long-term investors.\n",
    "Conversely, TSLA offers high return potential but with significant volatility, better suited for high-risk portfolios.\n",
    "These insights will directly inform the next project phase: technical indicators, anomaly detection, and trading signal generation."
