# ðŸ“Š Financial Analysis of Tech Companies (2020â€“2024)


This data science project performs a multi-stage analysis of the stock performance of five major U.S. technology companies â€” Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) â€” over the period 2020 to 2024.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Analyze historical stock price performance
- Evaluate risk-return metrics and inter-stock relationships
- Engineer technical indicators and detect market anomalies
- Prepare a clean dataset for future predictive modeling

---

## ðŸš€ Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, NumPy, yfinance
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Technical indicator logic built from scratch (no pre-built libraries)

---

## ðŸ§­ Project Structure

### ðŸ”¹ [Stage 1 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis](./1st_Analysis)

> Understand historical performance, daily returns, volatility, correlation, and Sharpe ratio.

**Key outputs:**
- Volatility heatmaps
- Rolling return plots
- Pairwise correlation visualizations
- Sharpe ratio comparison

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Stage 2 â€“ Technical Analysis](./2nd_Analysis)

> Engineer time-based technical indicators and identify periods of market anomalies.

**Technical Indicators:**
- SMA/EMA (10, 20, 50, 100, 200 days)
- RSI (14-day)
- MACD (12, 26, 9)
- Bollinger Bands (SMA 20 Â± 2Ïƒ)
- Rolling volatility
- Lagged features
- Anomaly detection (returns, RSI, volatility)

**Outputs:**
- Indicator plots per stock
- Anomaly graphs
- Final dataset for modeling: `df_model_ready.csv`

---

## âœ… Current Outcome

A well-documented, multi-step financial analysis pipeline producing a **structured dataset** enriched with engineered features â€” ready for machine learning in the next stage.

---

## ðŸ”œ Stage 3 â€“ (Coming Soon)

> Predictive modeling using supervised learning:
- Target: price direction, volatility regime, or anomaly prediction
- Models: logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost
- Feature importance analysis and backtesting
